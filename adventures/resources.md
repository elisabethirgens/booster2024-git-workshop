There are so very many things to read about Git on the internet, but these are some of my favourites.

## Oh Shit, Git!?!

> Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem. So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them in plain english.

> If you find git confusing, donâ€™t worry! Youâ€™re not alone. People whoâ€™ve been using it every day for years still make mistakes and arenâ€™t sure how to fix them. A lot of git commands are confusingly named (why do you create new branches with git checkout?) and there are 20 million different ways to do everything. This zine explains git fundamentals (whatâ€™s a SHA?) and how to fix a lot of common git mistakes (I committed to the wrong branch!!).

Julia has also written som great blog posts, like these:

- [Confusing git terminology](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/01/confusing-git-terminology/)

## Official Git documentation

These were once totally incomprehensible to me, but as I learn more and more Git, I have started to find them useful and I think itâ€™s helpful to practice navigate this site. I like this overview that lists commands in categories under different headings: [Reference â€” git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)

Getting more used to reading the way things are described officially, will make it easier to use the documentation available right in the terminal from commands like these:

```
git --help
git help -a
git rebase -h
```
