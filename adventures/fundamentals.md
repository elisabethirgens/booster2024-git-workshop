# The fundamentals ðŸŒ±

I wrote in the abstract for the Booster program that this workshop is for anyone who wants to take a wander with Git, no matter their starting point. You will need a laptop, and next you can check this list!

Itâ€™s perfectly fine if the answer is â€˜noâ€™ to something on this list â€” I am in fact _especially_ excited for YOU to join this workshop â€”Â but do get your grasp of these fundamentals before you dive into the other parts of the workshop (that will make assumptions about this stuff).

## You have some idea about what Git is

â€¦and why you want to learn more. You know the difference between Git and GitHub, and the basics of concepts like repository, commit, branch, pull request. If this is not something you are yet comfortable with, take a look at for example these resources:

- GitHub Docs: [About GitHub and Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git)
- and they also made this [Hello World exercise](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)

## You have used the command line

You know how to open your terminal and how to move around your directories with `cd`. If youâ€™re not entirely sure what that sentence means, then this is where your adventure starts.

- MDN: [Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#basic_built-in_terminal_commands)
- Or even better: ask a workshop attendee next to you if they can show you!

## You have an account on github

It is possible to use the tool `git` alone on your own laptop. But Git is more fun in collaboration with other people, and also with an account on GitHub you can play around in our project repository.

- Create your account on [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

## Your laptop has Git installed

- Run `git --version` to verify that you have Git installed

If you donâ€™t have Git installed on macOS, that command may prompt you to install **Xcode Command Line Tools** which will do the job. Or if this command gives you an error message: ask either the internet or someone next to you about how to install Git on your machine.

## You can clone

- http or ssh?
- `ssh -T git@github.com` to verify a connection to GitHub
