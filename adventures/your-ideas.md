# Your ideas and contributions!

Please do add more adventures in this project!

- learn a Git thing and show it to others here
- rant about your Git-related pet peeve
- anything you want to add, this repo is our playground for the workshop

## Use issues

Add new issues about Git things you want to learn today, especially if you for example want to collaborate with someone else on creating and resolving merge conflicts. Or for questions and discussions!

## Rules of the repo

⚠️ Avoid `push --force` to the `main` branch that others work on,<br>
but other than that: no rules that I can think of.

- wreak any havoc you want on branches
- push straigt to `main` if you want to test that kind of workflow
- create branches and open pull requests and ask someone else to review
- or not! merge away at will if you approve yourself
- any combination of merge commits, squashing, or rebasing is fine (try all three!)
