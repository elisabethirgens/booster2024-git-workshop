# which / version

There are many ways to install Git on your laptop. (Check out the guide below!) It can be helpful to be familiar with exactly how Git is installed on your laptop. It can be installed by your OS, perhaps by Homebrew or something else. And perhaps you can update?

- Find out `which git` you are using
- Does `git --version` show that you are using the latest version `2.44`?

> Git is released in versions. Which makes sense, but it’s not something I’ve thought about before. It became evident this week when I tried running a git command that my machine didn’t recognize.

— me 4 years ago when I realised I was using an old Git version <br>and then wrote this blog post: [Brew Install Git](https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/2020/03/brew-git/)
