# HEAD 🎩

I am barely “somewhat confident” in my understanding of HEAD, but Julia Evans is good at explaining computer things and she has written an excellent guide that I am looking forward to reading properly after I have completed this workshop for Booster… but you — you can study this one right now!

### Julia Evans: [How HEAD works in git](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/03/08/how-head-works-in-git/)
> HEAD is a reference to the current commit (or sometimes branch) in git. It’s a bit weird and confusing, and I think it’s one of the things that people often don’t understand very well when they’re learning git. I’m going to try to explain it here!
